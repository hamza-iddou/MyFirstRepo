I’m Hamza Iddou, a 21-year-old software engineering student with a focus on full-stack development and a growing interest in cloud and system programming. I’m currently interning at Inspiratech.ma, where I’m rebuilding their website and gaining real-world experience in tech services and development.

I balance my technical growth with creative hobbies like music, drawing, and fitness. Always curious, always leveling up—I’m building skills, projects, and a career with long-term impact.
